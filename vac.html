            <p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; border: 2px solid black;">Mahendra Singh Dhoni ( born <a style="color: purple;">7 July 1981</a>) is an Indian professional cricketer. He was captain of the Indian national team in limited-overs formats from <a style="color: purple;">2007 to 2017</a> and in Test cricket from <a style="color: purple;">2008 to 2014</a>. Dhoni is widely considered one of the greatest cricket captains, wicket-keeper-batsman and finishers in the history of cricket.

He is also the current captain of Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League.</p>
            <p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; border: 2px solid black;">The Indian ODI team in the early <a style="color: purple;">2000s</a> saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent. The team also saw the entry of wicket-keeper/batsmen from the junior ranks, with talents like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik (both India U-19 captains) named in the Test squads. With Dhoni making a mark in the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in <a style="color: purple;">2004/05</a>. Dhoni did not have a great start to his ODI career, getting run out for a duck on debut. In spite of an average series against Bangladesh, Dhoni was picked for the Pakistan ODI series.</p>
            <p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; border: 2px solid black;">He debuted in first class and List A Cricket in the season of <a style="color: purple;">1999â€“2000</a>.

            <h1 style="font-size: larger;">PLAYING STYLE</h1>
            <p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; border: 2px solid rebeccapurple;">Dhoni is a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper. Dhoni is an unorthodox batsman. He deviates from conventional coaching manuals and showcases his unique batting technique. Dhoni displays a proclivity for hitting full-length deliveries towards the<a style="color: red;">Long-on, Long-off, and Midwicket regions</a> , rather than the conventional Cover region. Furthermore, he demonstrates remarkable skill in playing pull shots and hook shots off short-pitched deliveries, putting pressure on the bowler to adjust their line and length accordingly. Dhoni holds the bat with a firm grip at the bottom of the handle, striking the ball with force and precision to clear the boundary. Despite this, he still retains the capability to produce awe-inspiring, long sixes. He is known for his unorthodox captaincy and cool-headed demeanor on the field. As a batsman, he is recognized for his remarkable finishing skills in high-pressure situations, and his aggressive captaincy has earned him the reputation of a successful leader in Indian cricket. He has also been renowned for his lightning-fast glove-work <a style="color: red;">behind the stumps</a>.</p>
